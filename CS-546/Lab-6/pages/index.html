                <h2>Chapter 1: Peter Breaks Through</h2>
                <p>
                    All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she
                    was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her
                    mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart
                    and cried, "Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!" This was all that passed between them on the
                    subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the
                    beginning of the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was
                    a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic mind was like the tiny
                    boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always
                    one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it
                    was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously
                    that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab
                    and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss. He
                    never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could have
                    got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him. He was one of those deep ones who
                    know about stocks and shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often
                    said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not
                    so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of
                    them there were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should have been totting up.
                    They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed.
                    Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs.
                    Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly. She wanted
                    to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper,
                    and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now don't interrupt," he would beg of her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings,
                    making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught
                    in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven&mdash;who is that moving?&mdash;eight nine seven, dot and carry
                    seven&mdash;don't speak, my own&mdash;and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door&mdash;quiet,
                    child&mdash;dot and carry child&mdash;there, you've done it!&mdash;did I say nine nine seven? yes, I
                    said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Of course we can, George," she cried. But she was prejudiced in Wendy's favour, and he was really the grander character
                    of the two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Remember mumps," he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again. "Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down,
                    but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings&mdash;don't speak&mdash;measles one five, German
                    measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six&mdash;don't waggle your finger&mdash;whooping-cough, say
                    fifteen shillings"&mdash;and so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy
                    just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might
                    have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their
                    nurse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of
                    course, they had a nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse
                    was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings
                    engaged her. She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted
                    with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and
                    was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.
                    She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment
                    of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. She
                    had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking
                    around your throat. She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made
                    sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety
                    to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved,
                    and butting them back into line if they strayed. On John's footer [in England soccer was called football,
                    "footer" for short] days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her
                    mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait.
                    They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They affected to ignore
                    her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She resented visits
                    to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore
                    and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily
                    whether the neighbours talked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had his position in the city to consider.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him. "I know she admires you tremendously,
                    George," Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice
                    to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join.
                    Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she
                    would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette
                    so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have
                    got it. There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother
                    after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking
                    into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. If you could keep awake
                    (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting
                    to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering
                    humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making
                    discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and
                    hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions
                    with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the
                    top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and
                    your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind,
                    which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like
                    your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more
                    or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking
                    craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through
                    which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very
                    small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first
                    day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the
                    dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your
                    tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through,
                    and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John
                    was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived
                    in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn
                    together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents,
                    but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could
                    say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are
                    for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of
                    the surf, though we shall land no more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances
                    between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and
                    table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes
                    very real. That is why there are night-lights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these
                    quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in
                    John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in
                    bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky
                    appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Yes, he is rather cocky," Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had been questioning her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "But who is he, my pet?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "He is Peter Pan, you know, mother."
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said
                    to live with the fairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of
                    the way with them, so that they should not be frightened. She had believed in him at the time, but now
                    that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Besides," she said to Wendy, "he would be grown up by this time."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh no, he isn't grown up," Wendy assured her confidently, "and he is just my size." She meant that he was her size in both
                    mind and body; she didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. "Mark my words," he said, "it is some nonsense Nana has been
                    putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it will blow over."
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For instance, they may remember to mention, a week
                    after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game
                    with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves
                    of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went
                    to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I do believe it is that Peter again!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whatever do you mean, Wendy?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet," Wendy said, sighing. She was a tidy child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on
                    the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know
                    how she knew, she just knew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I think he comes in by the window," she said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My love, it is three floors up."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she
                    had been dreaming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My child," the mother cried, "why did you not tell me of this before?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I forgot," said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but
                    she was sure they did not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering
                    at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the
                    walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty feet, without
                    so much as a spout to climb up by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on which the extraordinary adventures of these
                    children may be said to have begun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened to be Nana's evening off, and Mrs. Darling had
                    bathed them and sung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of
                    sleep.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly
                    lit by three night-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling's lap. Then her head nodded,
                    oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over there, John here,
                    and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth night-light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through
                    from it. He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who
                    have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in her dream he had
                    rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the
                    gap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did
                    drop on the floor. He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about
                    the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had
                    been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad in
                    skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that
                    he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.

                <h2>Chapter 2 The Shadow</h2>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out.
                    She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed,
                    this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look
                    for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing
                    but what she thought was a shooting star.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow. As he leapt
                    at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get
                    out; slam went the window and snapped it off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung it out at the window, meaning "He is sure to
                    come back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children."
                </p>
                <p>
                    But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the
                    whole tone of the house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats
                    for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame
                    to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say: "It all comes of having a dog for a nurse."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her
                    husband. Ah me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Of course it was a Friday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday," she used to say afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on
                    the other side of her, holding her hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No, no," Mr. Darling always said, "I am responsible for it all. I, George Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA." He had
                    had a classical education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came
                    through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27," Mrs. Darling said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana's bowl," said Mr. Darling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "If only I had pretended to like the medicine," was what Nana's wet eyes said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My liking for parties, George."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My fatal gift of humour, dearest."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought, "It's true, it's true, they ought not to have
                    had a dog for a nurse." Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana's eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That fiend!" Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana's bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was
                    something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun
                    so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael's
                    bath and carrying him to it on her back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I won't go to bed," he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, "I won't, I won't.
                    Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan't love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won't
                    be bathed, I won't, I won't!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in
                    her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm;
                    she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother," in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have
                    used on the real occasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask
                    to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michael had nearly cried. "Nobody wants me," he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I do," she said, "I so want a third child."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Boy or girl?" asked Michael, not too hopefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Boy."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if
                    that was to be Michael's last night in the nursery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They go on with their recollections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn't it?" Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been
                    like a tornado.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he
                    came to his tie. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks
                    and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest, but
                    there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used
                    a made-up tie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Why, what is the matter, father dear?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Matter!" he yelled; he really yelled. "This tie, it will not tie." He became dangerously sarcastic. "Not round my neck!
                    Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no!
                    Oh dear no! begs to be excused!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, "I warn you of this, mother, that unless
                    this tie is round my neck we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner to-night,
                    I never go to the office again, and if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children
                    will be flung into the streets."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. "Let me try, dear," she said, and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and
                    with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their fate
                    decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too
                    fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was
                    dancing round the room with Michael on his back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "How wildly we romped!" says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Our last romp!" Mr. Darling groaned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, 'How did you get to know me, mother?'"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I remember!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "They were rather sweet, don't you think, George?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her, covering his trousers
                    with hairs. They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them,
                    and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he
                    began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "George, Nana is a treasure."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I wonder," Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, "I wonder." It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy.
                    At first he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It is nobody I know," he said, examining it carefully, "but it does look a scoundrel."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We were still discussing it, you remember," says Mr. Darling, "when Nana came in with Michael's medicine. You will never
                    carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness,
                    it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the
                    spoon in Nana's mouth, he had said reprovingly, "Be a man, Michael."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Won't; won't!" Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this
                    showed want of firmness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Mother, don't pamper him," he called after her. "Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said,
                    'Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.'"
                </p>
                <p>
                    He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael,
                    "That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ever so much nastier," Mr. Darling said bravely, "and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost
                    the bottle."
                </p>
                <p>
                    He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did
                    not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I know where it is, father," Wendy cried, always glad to be of service. "I'll bring it," and she was off before he could
                    stop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "John," he said, shuddering, "it's most beastly stuff. It's that nasty, sticky, sweet kind."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It will soon be over, father," John said cheerily, and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I have been as quick as I could," she panted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You have been wonderfully quick," her father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her.
                    "Michael first," he said doggedly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Father first," said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I shall be sick, you know," Mr. Darling said threateningly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Come on, father," said John.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hold your tongue, John," his father rapped out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wendy was quite puzzled. "I thought you took it quite easily, father."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That is not the point," he retorted. "The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michael's spoon." His proud heart
                    was nearly bursting. "And it isn't fair: I would say it though it were with my last breath; it isn't
                    fair."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Father, I am waiting," said Michael coldly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Father's a cowardly custard."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "So are you a cowardly custard."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm not frightened."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Neither am I frightened."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, then, take it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Well, then, you take it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wendy had a splendid idea. "Why not both take it at the same time?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Certainly," said Mr. Darling. "Are you ready, Michael?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There was a yell of rage from Michael, and "O father!" Wendy exclaimed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What do you mean by 'O father'?" Mr. Darling demanded. "Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I&mdash;I missed
                    it."
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did not admire him. "Look here, all of you," he
                    said entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. "I have just thought of a splendid joke.
                    I shall pour my medicine into Nana's bowl, and she will drink it, thinking it is milk!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father's sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully
                    as he poured the medicine into Nana's bowl. "What fun!" he said doubtfully, and they did not dare expose
                    him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Nana, good dog," he said, patting her, "I have put a little milk into your bowl, Nana."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look:
                    she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl.
                    "O George," she said, "it's your medicine!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It was only a joke," he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy hugged Nana. "Much good," he said bitterly, "my
                    wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house."
                </p>
                <p>
                    And still Wendy hugged Nana. "That's right," he shouted. "Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,
                    why should I be coddled&mdash;why, why, why!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "George," Mrs. Darling entreated him, "not so loud; the servants will hear you." Somehow they had got into the way of calling
                    Liza the servants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Let them!" he answered recklessly. "Bring in the whole world. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for
                    an hour longer."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He felt he was a strong man again. "In vain,
                    in vain," he cried; "the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up this instant."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "George, George," Mrs. Darling whispered, "remember what I told you about that boy."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that house, and when commands would not draw Nana
                    from the kennel, he lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from
                    the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature,
                    which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat
                    in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear
                    Nana barking, and John whimpered, "It is because he is chaining her up in the yard," but Wendy was wiser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That is not Nana's unhappy bark," she said, little guessing what was about to happen; "that is her bark when she smells
                    danger."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Danger!
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Are you sure, Wendy?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Oh, yes."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars.
                    They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not
                    notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her
                    heart and made her cry, "Oh, how I wish that I wasn't going to a party to-night!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked, "Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights
                    are lit?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Nothing, precious," she said; "they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael flung his arms round her. "Mother," he cried,
                    "I'm glad of you." They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their
                    way over it deftly not to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all
                    the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything,
                    they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that
                    no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is
                    the star language), but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had
                    a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun
                    that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the
                    door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of
                    all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now, Peter!"
