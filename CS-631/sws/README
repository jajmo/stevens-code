Final Project - Group 2
=======================

Authors
-------
* Jason Ajmo (jajmo@stevens.edu)
* Jonah Mania (jmania@stevens.edu)
* Gurpreet Singh (gsingh14@stevens.edu)

Known Issues
------------
* When running as a daemon, absolute paths are required for `-c` and the root directory. This is
  required since daemon(3) chdir's to the root. We didn't have time to adjust the paths specified
* When running as a daemon, logging doesn't work properly when accessing home directories.
  We were never able to successfuly debug this
* There's some odd bugs that happen sometimes on certain operating systems. These bugs were not
  able to be resolved, especially since the SunOS box doesn't have any debugging tools

Notes
-------
* To compile on SunOS, `gmake(1)` must be used instead of `make(1)`
