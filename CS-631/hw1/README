============================
Author: Jason Ajmo (jajmo@stevens.edu)

Compiling
---------
* `make` will build both `tcp` and `tcpm`
* `make tcp` will build `tcp`
* `make tcpm` will build `tcpm`
* `make clean` cleans all object and temp files
* `make fclean` cleans all object, temp, and executable files
* `make re` is equivalent to `make fclean; make`

Notes
-----
* Written and tested on a clean NetBSD 7.1 installation
